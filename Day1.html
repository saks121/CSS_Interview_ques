    <h1> CSS Interview Day 1</h1>
    <h3>1.Explain inline , internal and external stylesheet.</h3>
    <p>
        External CSS:With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
        Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.
        <br>
        Internal CSS:An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.The internal style is defined inside the style tag element, inside the head section.
        <br>
        Inline CSS:An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.
    </p>

    <h3>2.What is css box model?</h3>
    <p>
        The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.
     <ol>       
        <li>Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear</li>
        <li>Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent</li>
        <li>Border - A border that goes around the padding and content</li>
        <li>Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent</li>
    </ol>    

    </p>

    <h3>4.Difference between flex row and column.</h3>
    <p>
        These both are flex-direction properties used in display :flex properties.
        <br>
        Flex-Row:The row value stacks the flex items horizontally (from left to right)
        <br>
        Flex-Column:The column value stacks the flex items vertically (from top to bottom)
    </p>

    <h3>5.Justify-content allows you to do what?</h3>
    <p>
        The justify-content property is used to align the flex items.
        We have different attribiutes here:
        The center value aligns the flex items at the center of the container
        The flex-start value aligns the flex items at the beginning of the container <stong>(this is default)</stong>
        The flex-end value aligns the flex items at the end of the container
        The space-around value displays the flex items with space before, between, and after the lines
        The space-between value displays the flex items with space between the lines

    </p>

    <h3>6.Difference between absolute and relative positioning</h3>
    <p>
        These both are types of position properties .]
        <br>
        Relative:
        An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
        Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. 
        Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
        <br>
        Absolute:
        An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

        However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
    </p>
    
    <h3>7.What is the z-index in CSS?</h3>
    <p>
        The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.
        The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element (which element should be placed in front of, or behind, the others).
        An element can have a positive or negative stack order
